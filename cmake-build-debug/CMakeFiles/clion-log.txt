CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.

CMake Warning (dev):
  Policy CMP0058 is not set: Ninja requires custom command byproducts to be
  explicit.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0058" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  This project specifies custom command DEPENDS on files in the build tree
  that are not specified as the OUTPUT or BYPRODUCTS of any
  add_custom_command or add_custom_target:

   run_test.sh

  For compatibility with versions of CMake that did not have the BYPRODUCTS
  option, CMake is generating phony rules for such files to convince 'ninja'
  to build.

  Project authors should add the missing BYPRODUCTS or OUTPUT options to the
  custom commands that produce these files.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
